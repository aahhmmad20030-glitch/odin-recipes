    <h3>how to meak pasat dish</h3>
    <p>
        To make a simple and satisfying pasta dish, begin by bringing a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil, then add about 400 grams of your favorite pasta shape and cook according to the package directions until it is al dente, ensuring you reserve about one cup of the starchy cooking water just before draining; simultaneously, in a separate pan, heat a few tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat, sautéing two minced cloves of garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds, and then pour in a 700-gram can of crushed tomatoes, adding a pinch of salt, pepper, a teaspoon of dried oregano, and a few fresh basil leaves, allowing the sauce to simmer for at least 15 minutes to let the flavors meld; once the sauce has thickened and the pasta is drained, toss the pasta directly into the sauce pan, adding a splash of the reserved pasta water to help the sauce coat the noodles smoothly, mixing everything thoroughly; finally, serve the pasta immediately, garnishing each plate generously with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and a drizzle of good quality extra virgin olive oil for a perfect finish.
